        **Before You Start...**

        This form is only for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        - Read the [docs](https://hufe.club/canvas-editor-docs/)

        Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.
        However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version,
        you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.
